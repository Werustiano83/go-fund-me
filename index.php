				<h1> gofundme.com Data Design Analysis </h1>
			</div>
			<h2> Persona </h2>
				<p> Mrs. Gene Orus has a big heart; since she's a widow and her "God Rest His Soul" husband left her in a very wealthy financial shape, she constantly looks for opportunities to give someone a financial lift. </p>
				<p> A couple of days ago she was at a church meeting and found out that the Church Choir was planning a field trip, and they were using gofundme.com to raise funds.</p>
				<p> Since she's very shy and someone told her that she could help anonymously, she decided to give it a try... she's not very tech savvy though. This is what she needs to donate money online:</p>

			<h2> Use Case</h2>
				<p>Mrs. Orus  becomes a fan of gofundme.com as well as other crowfunding sites. She gets into the habit of doing a little research for causes that she wants to support. Once a week she chooses that one cause where she can make a real difference anonimously.</p>
				<ol>
					<li> Her main purpose is to make a real difference to people in need.</li>
					<li> She does it because life has been good with her  and she wants to practice some gratitude. </li>
					<li> She decides to choose a cause and donate once a week.</li>
					<li> She doesn't have a computer at home, so she goes to the public library to use their desktops, sometimes she uses a desktop at her church. </li>
					<li> The library desktops are all equipped with Windows 8 and an internet connection that has decent speed. The desktop at church, has Windows XP, the internet coonnection at church fails a lot. </li>
